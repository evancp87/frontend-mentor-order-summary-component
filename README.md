## My process

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
 - For styles

### What I learned

Although i've worked on much more complex projects in the past, having moved away from html/css to focusing more on logic and algorithms with JS and React, i wanted to go back to basics, and this was a good place to start. I enjoyed using Sass mixins to write DRY and efficient styles, and i look forward to experimenting more with this pre-processor in future projects.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  
@mixin btn($bg-color, $color, $btn-width, $font-weight, $font-size, $border-radius) {
    background-color: $bg-color;
    color: $color;
    width: $btn-width;
    font-weight: $font-weight;
    font-size: $font-size;
    border-radius: $border-radius;
}
 
}
```


### Continued development

As outlined above, i want to take a deeper dive into Sass, particularly Sass functions and modules.
